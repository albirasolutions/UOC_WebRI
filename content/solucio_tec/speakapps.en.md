      SpeakApps represents an innovative language teaching solution with online
      tools and materials designed specifically for language students to be able
      to practise and improve oral skills when learning a language. SpeakApps
      consists of four tools:


      * Langblog: Audio/Videoblog designed for oral activity learning

      * Tandem: Tool that enables students to carry out pair work to foster oral
      practice. It distributes materials in real time to enhance interaction
      between the students.

      * Videochat: Tool that allows videoconferencing sessions with up to six
      people, helping the students organize and record sessions without the
      teacher present and allowing the teacher to listen to and assess the
      individual interventions of each participant.

      * Open Educational Resources (OER): Online language teaching activities
      and materials creation and editing tool that includes a repository of
      materials with a Creative Commons licence.


      The four tools can easily be integrated into any educational platform
      compatible with the IMS LTI standard.


      In addition, the SpeakApps Community, aimed at language teachers, learning
      technologies developers and all types of language learning-related
      institutions, promotes the contribution and exchange of language teaching
      contents, services and teaching methodologies.

      SpeakApps allows activities to be done for online oral language practice
      that have traditionally been done in person: students and teachers can
      interact flexibly, easily and intuitively, simplifying interfaces and
      unifying formats. This improves the education experience, focusing efforts
      on learning and avoiding dispersion in the use of the technology.\

      \

      It has been shown that by using SpeakApps:


      * students have a greater feeling of belonging to a group, they are more
      motivated and the quality of speaking skills learning increases.

      * teachers have more powerful tools and resources to promote and assess
      oral language practice among the students.


      SpeakApps was awarded the silver medal in the Learning Impact 2014 awards,
      organized by the[IMS Global Learning
      Consortium](http://www.imsglobal.org/), a non profit-making organization
      that seeks to promote the growth and impact of learning technologies in
      higher education.

      SpeakApps is initially designed for distance language teaching, but it can
      also be used as oral language reinforcement in on-site or blended models.
      The UOC offers a series of services so that interested institutions can
      get the most out of SpeakApps:


      * Integration service on the institution's education platform.

      * SAAS service (access to tools in the cloud if the institution does not
      have an education platform).

      * Technical support (for installation problems, maintenance, etc.).

      * Educational support (adaptation of activities to online teaching).

      * Training (SpeakApps tools, e-teaching, etc.).
