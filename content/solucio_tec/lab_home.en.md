      Tool for the distance teaching of basic analogue electronics skills. It
      comprises an electronic instrumentation board with PC connectivity and
      associated software to manage it.[Lab@Home](mailto:Lab@Home)allows the
      student to learn, through practice, the design and assembly of electronic
      circuits and the use of the signal generation apparatus of an electronics
      laboratory, with which they will be able to power the circuits and take
      measurements with a multimeter and an oscilloscope.

      The solution constitutes a low-cost portable analogue electronics
      laboratory. It can, then, be applied to the online learning of the basic
      electronics skills (design and assembly of electronic circuits and the use
      of the signal generation apparatus of an electronics laboratory) that are
      acquired in on-site education.


      In addition, its autonomy enables on-site teaching to optimize laboratory
      practice time, which means it can be tailored to students' different
      learning paces.
