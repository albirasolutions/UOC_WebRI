      A video watermark is a sequence of bits embedded in a video signal. They
      are imperceptible to the human senses and are only detected by devices
      such as smartphones or tablets. A watermark contains unique identifiers of
      both the portion of the video[](<>)from which the mark was extracted and
      the distribution source to which the content can be credited.


      Our innovative approach is the best way to fight tampering and
      counterfeiting. Moreover, it provides a trade-off between capacity,
      transparency and bit rate, with multiple advantages:


      * Total reversibility, as the original content can easily be fully
      restored.

      * Zero distortion of the content.

      * Greater robustness, as the hidden stream is encrypted using several
      keys.

      * Real-time extraction processes, since only entropy decoding is required,
      not total decompression of the video.

      * Minimum alteration of the video bit rate.


      Greater reliability, since the risk of losing the watermark due to
      compression is avoided.

      * Digital security - Authentication and confirmation of genuine content
      for video on demand (4K, UHD, HDR, etc.) 

      * Another layer of security for video content, very difficult to remove
      despite resizing, re-compression, cropping or re-digitization. 

      * Detection of counterfeiting and piracy, including a reliable way to
      trace the source of the leak. 

      * Forensics analysis to be integrated in DRM for video on demand. Media
      analytics 

      * Audience measurements and broadcasting monitoring. 

      * Measure campaign effectiveness.  

      * Consumer analytics on broadcasting, video on demand or even internet
      distribution. 

      * Better connection between TV broadcasts and users, increasing viewer
      engagement. Information embedding 

      * Information such as subtitles, translations, or news items can be
      embedded in the video.
